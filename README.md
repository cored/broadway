Broadway 

Broadway helps developers deploy their projects with defining their deployment
workflows in Broadway playbooks. It runs as a service interacting with
Kubernetes and allowing users to interact with it through various interfaces
(Slack, CLI, Web).

## Playbook
A Broadway Playbook is a YAML file for defining a project's deployment tasks.

```yaml
---
id: web
name: Web Project
meta:
  team: Web team
  email: webteam@namely.com
  slack: web
vars:
  - version
  - assets_version
  - owner
tasks:
  - name: Deploy Postgres
    manifests:
      - postgres-rc
      - postgres-service
  - name: Deploy Redis
    manifests:
      - redis-rc
      - redis-service
  - name: Database Migration
    pod_manifest:
      - migration-pod
    wait_for:
      - success
  - name: Deploy Web
    manifests:
      - web-rc
      - web-service
      - worker-rc
```

## Instance
An instance represents a Broadway instance that may or may not be deployed.
Good usecase is when a CI server creates an instance in Broadway sending the
version then the user can deploy the instance from Slack.

Instance Statuses:
 - new
 - deploying
 - deployed
 - deleting
 - error

Instance Attributes:
 - playbook id – playbook identifier (String)
 - id – instance identifier (String)
 - status – instance status
 - created – when the instance was created
 - vars – map of String values
